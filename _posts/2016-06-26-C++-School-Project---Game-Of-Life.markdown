description: This is a project done for a school course named "Methods and Utilities in Softwareprojects". The main purpose of the project was to introduce us students to version control, agile- and test driven development. The project is an implementation of Game of Life, it uses Conway's rule as well as custom rules developed by me and my two co-workers.
